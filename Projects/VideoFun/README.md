## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and Docker Compose
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/itsskofficial/Web2.git
    cd videofun
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        ```
    *   Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker:
        ```sh
        docker-compose up -d
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file from the template:
        ```sh
        cp .env.template .env
        ```
    *   Update the `.env` file with your database connection string and JWT secrets. The default database URL for the Docker setup is:
        ```
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:123@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    *   Run database migrations:
        ```sh
        npx prisma migrate dev
        ```
    *   Start the backend server:
        ```sh
        npm run start:dev
        ```
    *   The backend will be running at **[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)** and the GraphQL playground at **[http://localhost:3001/graphql](http://localhost:3001/graphql)**.

3.  **Frontend Setup**
    *   In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```sh
        cd frontend
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    *   Start the frontend development server:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   The application will be available at **[http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174)**.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:
*   Create an account or log in to your existing account.

*   **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Implement a full suite of backend (Jest) and frontend (Vitest/Cypress) tests.
*   **CI/CD & Cloud Deployment:** Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to a cloud provider like Vercel or AWS.
