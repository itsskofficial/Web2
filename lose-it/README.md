# minska-ui
VueJS-App to optimize weight loss and track calories.
Minska means to lose weight in Swedish. And that's exactly what you can do with Minska.
The fastest and most useful way to lose weight is to count the calories you consume. This is the basic principle of all apps that are designed to help you lose weight. Whether this happens in points (Weightwatchers) or directly in calories, does not matter. With this tactic, it doesn't matter what you eat, it just matters how much. Accordingly, you can occasionally treat yourself to a calorie bomb as long as you don't go beyond your daily routine. Strictly speaking, sport is not necessary either, but you can use it to expand your calorie frame yourself.
